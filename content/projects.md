Here are some of the projects I have worked on over the years:

- [News-Feed](https://github.com/venkatabhishek/NewsFeed): An auto-generated news feed that leverages multiple API for content generation and extraction
- [Tetris](https://github.com/venkatabhishek/js-tetris): An attempt at building tetris from scratch in HTML/Javascript
